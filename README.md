# FloraFinder
### This apps provides the user with a collection of information about
#### flora local to the user's given area. 
#### Use to learn more information about local plant species.
#### Categorizes them taxonomically, as well as based on whether a given species
#### is native, naturalized, or invasive- as well as endangerment status.
#### Can also show species related to your query, 
#### and the areas of the world in which they can be found.
#### Plants will also be labeled based on edibility and/or known medicinal use (or lack thereof),
#### from safely edible, to those that are not dangerous but also not recommended to eat 
#### for whatever reason (most of these likely being considered so due to rough, indigestible 
#### material, or undesirable taste or texture, etc), to those that come with a strict warning
#### and are poisonous. There will probably also be an "undetermined" category for those
#### without enough information in that regard, which will also be distinctly recommended to avoid
#### eating. 
### Planning a trip to a different climate? 
#### You can use this app to learn about the flora of your target destination, 
#### and plan accordingly. Perhaps you may even base
#### your destination itself around this info.
