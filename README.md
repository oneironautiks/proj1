### This apps provides the user with a collection of information about
#### trees local to NYC. 
#### Use to learn more information about local tree species.
#### Categorizes them taxonomically, as well as based on whether a given species
#### is native, naturalized, or invasive- as well as endangerment status.
#### Filter by location, you can get as specific as 
#### individual trees and the blocks they can be found on.
#### Learn more about your local flora!
### Planning a trip to a different climate? 
#### You can use this app to learn about the flora of your target destination, 
#### and plan accordingly. Perhaps you may even base
#### your destination itself around this info. 

#### I plan to use the trefle.io API to gather plant data, 
#### and possibly the wikipedia API to collect more information
#### on various tree species. I will use these in collaboration with
#### a TBD location API, in order to connect species with location. 
#### The MVP will need to have basic taxonomical info on trees 
#### based on location. Post-MVP additional features will be to include
#### more detailed info for each species and varieties, such as whether they're edible 
#### or not (usually referring to the fruit), medicinal or not, other uses, lore, etc.
